Hi, I'm Manjula Mishra, an aspiring data scientist focused on helping companies and tech startups in housing industry. 

My interest lies in analyzing economic issues particularly housing market from socio-economic-environment and sustainability perspective. I also enjoy creating surveys to gather data firsthand. 

Studying economics taught me to be an analytical thinker. Training in econometrics and statistics provided me tools to convert analytical thinking into useful information. Finally, my data science journey is teaching me how to handle big data and make accurate predictions using statistical models in python. My previous projects invloved cleaning, processing, and analyzing raw data with STATA and SPSS.
