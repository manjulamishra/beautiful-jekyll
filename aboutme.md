Hi, I'm Manjula Mishra, an aspiring data scientist focused on helping establisehd firms and tech startups. My interest lies in analyzing economic issues particularly housing market from socio-economic-environment sustainability perspective.

Studying economics taught me to be an analytical thinker. Training in econometrics and statistics provided me tools to convert analytical thinking into useful information. Finally, my data science journey is teaching me how to handle big data and make accurate predictions using statistical models in python.
