title: About me
---

Hi, I'm Manjula Mishra, a data scientist/economist. I studied economics for the longest time I can remember. I enjoy doing statistics and econometrics always fascinates me. However, what excites me most is the data science training combined with my knowledge of economics. Doing data science using Python has been powerful. This rich computer language has provided me powerful tools to analyze data in a way that I didn't know was possible. I enjoy learning about incredibly well maintained and useful Python libraries and packages for data wrangling, analysis and visualization purposes. One of my goals is to start making small contributions to this massive language (besides learning R). 

Some of the skills I learned through my data science training incldue: pandas, numpy, scipy, SKLearn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, plotly, Regression Analysis, Classification Models, Clustering, PCA, Tree Ensembles: Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, NLP, Artificial Neural Networks, Keras, AWS:SageMaker, SQL, PostgresSQL, and GitHub workflow.
