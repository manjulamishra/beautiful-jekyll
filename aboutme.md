Hi, I'm Manjula Mishra, a data scientist/economist. I enjoy thinking about issues in subjective ways. It helps me think beyond numbers. I like appraoching problems from an interdisciplinary perspective. Learning data science has been a powerful complimentary skill to my knowldege of economics, statistics and econometrics. 

I practice data science in Python. I enjoy learning about Python's useful libraries and packages for data wrangling, analysis and visualizations. I enjoy writing codes to automate my job. More I learn, more I appriciate the beauty of machine learning. My near future goal is to learn another great langauge: R.

The main libraires I explored through my data science training incldue: pandas, numpy, scipy, SKLearn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, plotly, Tree Ensembles: Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, and Keras.
