Hi, I'm Manjula Mishra, a data scientist. I like applying machine learning to different fields of economics as well other areas. Learning data science provided me a set complimentary skills to my knowldege of statistics and econometrics. I practice data science in Python. I like exploring Python's useful libraries and packages for data wrangling, analysis and visualizations. I enjoy writing codes to automate and standarize data cleaning and manipulation process. My near future goal is to start using another great langauge: R.

The main libraires I explored through my data science training incldue: pandas, numpy, scipy, SKLearn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, plotly, Tree Ensembles: Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, and Keras.
