Project Proposal

Housing industry is a very well researched space. Yet it is fascinating to observe new topics of interest emerging with time. For last two decades, the focus has shifting towards bringing sustainability in housing industry. From remodeling old homes to new constructions, the effort is to make houses energy efficient and low maintenance. The modern architecture is simpler yet appealing to younger generation. What factors affect our choices? How income, education, location, and environmental awareness play a role in the decision making? 


Objectives

My objective is to analyze new trends in housing industry. The aim is to find if remodeling and new constructions are leaning towards eco-friendly homes and in turn, if this trend can be explained through socio-economic status of the population, education, or geographic location.  

1. Who are the top ten companies who build such homes?  
2. How much people spend of eco-friendly concepts if they are remodeling their homes?
3. Are there long term benefits?
4. What are the upfront, and overall costs?
5. Do education level, income, and geographic area affect their decisions? 
6. How to measure the success in terms of satisfaction and monetary saving?

How

*   Find a dataset which has the required information
*   Inspect the dataset in Python and do the appropriate data cleaning
*   Conduct a meaningful analysis throughh statisitcal techniques
*   Show the work through tables and other visualizations
*   Write a story that conveys the findings

Challenges

1. How to define sustainable homes?
2. Where and how to find the right dataset from?
3. How to decide what statistical techniques to use?
4. How to create the most effective visualizations?
5. Writing a good readable story
