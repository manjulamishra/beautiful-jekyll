## [Predicting Functional Water Pumps in Tanzania using Random Forests and Logistic Regression in Python](https://itnext.io/predicting-functional-water-pumps-in-tanzania-using-random-forests-and-logistic-regression-in-ffa04b0617f2)

Tanzaniaâ€™s water pumps dataset presented unique set of interesting problems related to data cleaning and predictions. Working on this data required some thinking about the end goal, reading data carefully, paying attention to the details, and deciding what hidden information in the data was important. It was a classification analysis to accurately predict the different classes.The target variable consisted of three classes of water pumps: Functional, Non-function, and the ones that required repair work.  The challenge was to acurately predict which pumps were functional.
